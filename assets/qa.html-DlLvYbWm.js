Another reason is that by inheriting the <code>IHttpApi</code> interface, the proxy classes for the HTTP interfaces have a Dispose method.</p><h2 id="can-an-http-interface-inherit-from-another-http-interface" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#can-an-http-interface-inherit-from-another-http-interface"><span>Can an HTTP interface inherit from another HTTP interface?</span></a></h2><p>Yes, it is possible to inherit from another HTTP interface. The methods of the parent interface will also be treated as API methods. However, it is important to note that the interface-level attributes of the parent interface will be overridden by those of the child interface. Therefore, for better understanding, it is recommended not to use this kind of inheritance.</p><h2 id="how-can-i-validate-the-validity-of-a-proxy-before-using-the-proxyattribute-host-port-attribute" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-can-i-validate-the-validity-of-a-proxy-before-using-the-proxyattribute-host-port-attribute"><span>How can I validate the validity of a proxy before using the <code>[ProxyAttribute(host,port)]</code> attribute?</span></a></h2><p>You can use the Validate method of the ProxyValidator object to validate the validity of a proxy.</p><h2 id="why-is-it-not-supported-to-declare-the-return-type-of-an-interface-method-as-task-instead-of-task-or-itask" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-is-it-not-supported-to-declare-the-return-type-of-an-interface-method-as-task-instead-of-task-or-itask"><span>Why is it not supported to declare the return type of an interface method as <code>Task</code> instead of <code>Task&lt;&gt;</code> or <code>ITask&lt;&gt;</code>?</span></a></h2><p>This is a design principle. Regardless of whether the developer is interested in the return value or not, an HTTP request will either have a response or throw an exception. If you are not interested in parsing the response, you can declare the return type as <code>Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt;</code> without actually parsing the <code>HttpResponseMessage</code>.</p><h2 id="how-can-i-download-a-file-using-webapiclient" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-can-i-download-a-file-using-webapiclient"><span>How can I download a file using WebApiClient?</span></a></h2><p>You should declare the return type of the interface as <code>ITask&lt;HttpResponseFile&gt;</code>.</p><h2 id="besides-declaring-the-return-type-of-an-interface-as-itask-httpresponsemessage-what-other-abstract-return-types-can-be-declared" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#besides-declaring-the-return-type-of-an-interface-as-itask-httpresponsemessage-what-other-abstract-return-types-can-be-declared"><span>Besides declaring the return type of an interface as <code>ITask&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt;</code>, what other abstract return types can be declared?</span></a></h2><p>Other abstract return types that can be declared include <code>ITask&lt;string&gt;</code>, <code>ITask&lt;Stream&gt;</code>, and <code>ITask&lt;Byte[]&gt;</code>.</p><h2 id="can-the-parameters-declared-in-an-interface-be-of-type-object-or-certain-base-classes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#can-the-parameters-declared-in-an-interface-be-of-type-object-or-certain-base-classes"><span>Can the parameters declared in an interface be of type Object or certain base classes?</span></a></h2><p>Yes, you can declare parameters in an interface as Object or certain base classes.
